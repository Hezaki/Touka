      ;; on the command line, then restart emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
      ;; use 'm-x doom/reload'.


      ;; to install some-package from melpa, elpa or emacsmirror:
      ;; (package! some-package)

      ;; to install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
      ;; `:recipe'. you'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
      ;; https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el#the-recipe-format
      ;; (package! another-package
      ;;   :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

      ;; if the package you are trying to install does not contain a packagename.el
      ;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
      ;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
      ;; (package! this-package
      ;;   :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
      ;;            :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

      ;; if you'd like to disable a package included with doom, you can do so here
      ;; with the `:disable' property:
      ;; (package! builtin-package :disable t)

      ;; you can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
      ;; all the properties for `:recipe'. these will inherit the rest of its recipe
      ;; from doom or melpa/elpa/emacsmirror:
      ;; (package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
      ;; (package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

      ;; specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
      ;; this is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
      ;; our package manager can't deal with; see radian-software/straight.el#279)
      ;; (package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

      ;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:
      ;;
      ;; - `doom-font' -- the primary font to use
      ;; - `doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
      ;; - `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
      ;;   presentations or streaming.
      ;; - `doom-symbol-font' -- for symbols
      ;; - `doom-serif-font' -- for the `fixed-pitch-serif' face
      ;;
      ;; See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they
      ;; accept. For example:
      ;;
      ;;(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
      ;;      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans" :size 13))
      ;;
      ;; If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them
      ;; up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to
      ;; refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely
      ;; wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!

      ;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
      ;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
      ;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
      (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

      ;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
      ;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
      (setq display-line-numbers-type t)

      ;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
      ;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
      (setq org-directory "~/Documents/Notes")


      ;; Whenever you reconfigure a package, make sure to wrap your config in an
      ;; `after!' block, otherwise Doom's defaults may override your settings. E.g.
      ;;
      ;;   (after! PACKAGE
      ;;     (setq x y))
      ;;
      ;; The exceptions to this rule:
      ;;
      ;;   - Setting file/directory variables (like `org-directory')
      ;;   - Setting variables which explicitly tell you to set them before their
      ;;     package is loaded (see 'C-h v VARIABLE' to look up their documentation).
      ;;   - Setting doom variables (which start with 'doom-' or '+').
      ;;
      ;; Here are some additional functions/macros that will help you configure Doom.
      ;;
      ;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
      ;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
      ;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
      ;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
      ;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
      ;;   `require' or `use-package'.
      ;; - `map!' for binding new keys
      ;;
      ;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
      ;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
      ;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
      ;; Alternatively, use `C-h o' to look up a symbol (functions, variables, faces,
      ;; etc).
      ;;
      ;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
      ;; they are implemented.
